The data set contains various columns that effect the employees of the company. Based on the given factors, it is observed if an employee has left the company or not. By analysing the given information, we will create an employee churn model through which we can predict if any employee is going to leave the company any or not. The predictions are purely based on previous records.

Factors to be analysed for employee churn prediction:

Satisfaction level: Shows how satisfied the employee is based on a scale of 0 to 1, 0 being least satisfied and 1 being highly satisfied

Last evaluation: Shows the last evaluation report

Number of projects: The number of projects done by the employee while in the company. 

Average monthly hours: average monthly hours spent in the company by the employee. 

Time spent: Years spent in the company by the employee. 

Work accidents: Number of accidents due to official work 

Left: If the employee has left the company or not. 1 being yes and 0 being no

Promotion: If the employee had a promotion is last 5 years or not 

Department of the employee: The employee is from which department

Salary: Salary of the employee in a range of low, medium, high

Based on these factors, an employee churn model will be developed to determine if the employee will leave the company in near future or not.For this project we will be evaluating a dataset composed of human resources data. Our objective is to build a model (or models) that predict whether or not an employee is likely to leave his/her job based on characteristics in the dataset.
