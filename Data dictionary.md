The data set contains various columns that effect the employees of the company. Based on the given factors, it is observed if an employee has left the company or not. By analysing the given information, we will create an employee churn model through which we can predict if any employee is going to leave the company any or not. The predictions are purely based on previous records.

Factors to be analysed for employee churn prediction:

Based on these factors, an employee churn model will be developed to determine if the employee will leave the company in near future or not.For this project we will be evaluating a dataset composed of human resources data. Our objective is to build a model (or models) that predict whether or not an employee is likely to leave his/her job based on characteristics in the dataset.
