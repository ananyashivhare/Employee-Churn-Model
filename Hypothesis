Hypothesis:
H0 = Null Hypothesis; Hypothesis that are believed to be true or are needed to be proved
true based on the experiments
H1 = Alternative Hypothesis; Hypothesis that is reached if and only if null hypothesis is
rejected.
For this project, we are trying to analyse the factors that effect the employee attrition for a
specific company. Hence, our hypothesis would be as follows:

Hypothesis-1:
H0 = Attrition depends on the age of the employees.
H1 = Attrition is independent of the employeeâ€™s age.

Hypothesis-2:
H0 = Attrition is independent of the daily wages of the employee.
H1 = Attrition depends on the daily wages of the employee.

Hypothesis-3:
H0 = Distance of the office from home plays a role in employee attrition.
H1 = Distance of the office from home does not play a role in employee attrition.

Hypothesis-4:
H0 = Employee attrition is independent of the gender.
H1 = Employee attrition depends on the gender.

Hypothesis-5:
H0 = Marital status of the employee affects attrition.
H1 = Marital status of the employee does not affect attrition.

Hypothesis-6:
H0 = Frequent business travel plays a role in attrition.
H1 = Frequent business travels does not play in attrition.
